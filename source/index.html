	Your business depends on feeding your sales pipeline with fresh information about the most relevant government bid opportunities, but most of the tools for finding them feel outdated and clunky.  They waste your time by making you scroll through page after page of results you don't want just to find the one that you do.  Or they force you to enter and re-enter combinations of keywords to narrow down the results to a manageable list.

	Opportunity discovery is what fills your sales pipeline, and a tool that offers smarter search and information where and when you need it most will streamline business development.  What if you had technology at your disposal that would meet you halfway?  Technology that could personalize your searches?  Technology that could sort results based on your preferences and past selections?

      <p>
	BetterFBO is being designed from the ground up as a tool that meets you halfway.  Building on a core of government procurement data, it will provide a modern solution for federal business opportunities discovery that beats FBO.gov every day of the week and twice on Sundays.  The goal is to give you the most relevant and up-to-the-minute information that you need to plan your next moves and make more sales.
