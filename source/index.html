    If you're learning about bid opportunities too late or chasing the
    wrong leads, it's hurting your bottom line.

      Your business pipeline depends on a steady stream of the latest
      information about relevant government bid opportunities, but most of the
      tools for finding them feel outdated and amateurish.  They waste your time
      by making you scroll through page after page of results that don't
      interest you just to find the one opportunity that you do.  Or they force
      you to waste time entering and re-entering combinations of keywords just
      to narrow the results down to a manageable list.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're paid to seek out opportunities, not to try to outsmart search
      engines. Opportunity discovery is what fills your sales funnel, and you
      need a tool speaks your language to streamline and simplify business
      development.  How much easier would your job be if you had technology
      at your disposal that would meet you halfway?  Technology that could
      personalize your searches?  Technology that could sort results based
      on your preferences and past selections?  That technology is about to
      arrive.
